There are two typical ways to implement autograd, via symbolic differentiation
like [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/index.html) or reverse
differentiation like
[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/autograd.html). SINGA follows
Pytorch way, which records the computation graph and apply the backward
propagation automatically after forward propagation. The autograd algorithm is
explained in details
[here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/autograd.html). We explain the
relevant modules in Singa and give an example to illustrate the usage.

## Relevant Modules

There are three classes involved in autograd, namely `singa.tensor.Tensor`,
`singa.autograd.Operation`, and `singa.autograd.Layer`. In the rest of this
article, we use tensor, operation and layer to refer to an instance of the
respective class.

### Tensor

Three attributes of Tensor are used by autograd,

- `.creator` is an `Operation` instance. It records the operation that generates
  the Tensor instance.
- `.requires_grad` is a boolean variable. It is used to indicate that the
  autograd algorithm needs to compute the gradient of the tensor (i.e., the
  owner). For example, during backpropagation, the gradients of the tensors for
  the weight matrix of a linear layer and the feature maps of a convolution
  layer (not the bottom layer) should be computed.
- `.stores_grad` is a boolean variable. It is used to indicate that the gradient
  of the owner tensor should be stored and output by the backward function. For
  example, the gradient of the feature maps is computed during backpropagation,
  but is not included in the output of the backward function.

Programmers can change `requires_grad` and `stores_grad` of a Tensor instance.
For example, if later is set to True, the corresponding gradient is included in
the output of the backward function. It should be noted that if `stores_grad` is
True, then `requires_grad` must be true, not vice versa.

### Operation

It takes one or more `Tensor` instances as input, and then outputs one or more
`Tensor` instances. For example, ReLU can be implemented as a specific Operation
subclass. When an `Operation` instance is called (after instantiation), the
following two steps are executed:

1. record the source operations, i.e., the `creator`s of the input tensors.
2. do calculation by calling member function `.forward()`

There are two member functions for forwarding and backwarding, i.e.,
`.forward()` and `.backward()`. They take `Tensor.data` as inputs (the type is
`CTensor`), and output `Ctensor`s. To add a specific operation, subclass
`operation` should implement their own `.forward()` and `.backward()`. The
`backward()` function is called by the `backward()` function of autograd
automatically during backward propogation to compute the gradients of inputs
(according to the `require_grad` field).

### Layer

For those operations that require parameters, we package them into a new class,
`Layer`. For example, convolution operation is wrapped into a convolution layer.
`Layer` manages (stores) the parameters and calls the corresponding `Operation`s
to implement the transformation.

## Examples

Multiple examples are provided in the
[example folder](https://github.com/apache/singa/tree/master/examples/autograd).
We explain two representative examples here.

### Operation only

The following codes implement a MLP model using only Operation instances (no
Layer instances).

#### Import packages

```python
from singa.tensor import Tensor
from singa import autograd
from singa import opt
```

#### Create weight matrix and bias vector

The parameter tensors are created with both `requires_grad` and `stores_grad`
set to `True`.

```python
w0 = Tensor(shape=(2, 3), requires_grad=True, stores_grad=True)
w0.gaussian(0.0, 0.1)
b0 = Tensor(shape=(1, 3), requires_grad=True, stores_grad=True)
b0.set_value(0.0)

w1 = Tensor(shape=(3, 2), requires_grad=True, stores_grad=True)
w1.gaussian(0.0, 0.1)
b1 = Tensor(shape=(1, 2), requires_grad=True, stores_grad=True)
b1.set_value(0.0)
```

#### Training

```python
inputs = Tensor(data=data)  # data matrix
target = Tensor(data=label) # label vector
autograd.training = True    # for training
sgd = opt.SGD(0.05)   # optimizer

for i in range(10):
    x = autograd.matmul(inputs, w0) # matrix multiplication
    x = autograd.add_bias(x, b0)    # add the bias vector
    x = autograd.relu(x)            # ReLU activation operation

    x = autograd.matmul(x, w1)
    x = autograd.add_bias(x, b1)

    loss = autograd.softmax_cross_entropy(x, target)

    for p, g in autograd.backward(loss):
        sgd.update(p, g)
```

### Operation + Layer

The following
[example](https://github.com/apache/singa/blob/master/examples/autograd/mnist_cnn.py)
implements a CNN model using layers provided by the autograd module.

#### Create the layers

```python
conv1 = autograd.Conv2d(1, 32, 3, padding=1, bias=False)
bn1 = autograd.BatchNorm2d(32)
pooling1 = autograd.MaxPool2d(3, 1, padding=1)
conv21 = autograd.Conv2d(32, 16, 3, padding=1)
conv22 = autograd.Conv2d(32, 16, 3, padding=1)
bn2 = autograd.BatchNorm2d(32)
linear = autograd.Linear(32 * 28 * 28, 10)
pooling2 = autograd.AvgPool2d(3, 1, padding=1)
```

#### Define the forward function

The operations in the forward pass will be recorded automatically for backward
propagation.

```python
def forward(x, t):
    # x is the input data (a batch of images)
    # t is the label vector (a batch of integers)
    y = conv1(x)           # Conv layer
    y = autograd.relu(y)   # ReLU operation
    y = bn1(y)             # BN layer
    y = pooling1(y)        # Pooling Layer

    # two parallel convolution layers
    y1 = conv21(y)
    y2 = conv22(y)
    y = autograd.cat((y1, y2), 1)  # cat operation
    y = autograd.relu(y)           # ReLU operation
    y = bn2(y)
    y = pooling2(y)

    y = autograd.flatten(y)        # flatten operation
    y = linear(y)                  # Linear layer
    loss = autograd.softmax_cross_entropy(y, t)  # operation
    return loss, y
```

#### Training

```python
autograd.training = True
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for i in range(batch_number):
        inputs = tensor.Tensor(device=dev, data=x_train[
                               i * batch_sz:(1 + i) * batch_sz], stores_grad=False)
        targets = tensor.Tensor(device=dev, data=y_train[
                                i * batch_sz:(1 + i) * batch_sz], requires_grad=False, stores_grad=False)

        loss, y = forward(inputs, targets) # forward the net

        for p, gp in autograd.backward(loss):  # auto backward
            sgd.update(p, gp)
```

### Using the Model API

The following [example](https://github.com/apache/singa/blob/master/examples/cnn/model/cnn.py)
implements a CNN model using the [Model API](./graph).

#### Define the subclass of Model

Define the model class, it should be the subclass of Model. In this way, all
operations used during the training phase will form a computational graph and
will be analyzed. The operations in the graph will be scheduled and executed
efficiently. Layers can also be included in the model class.

```python
class MLP(model.Model):  # the model is a subclass of Model

    def __init__(self, data_size=10, perceptron_size=100, num_classes=10):
        super(MLP, self).__init__()

        # init the operators, layers and other objects
        self.relu = layer.ReLU()
        self.linear1 = layer.Linear(perceptron_size)
        self.linear2 = layer.Linear(num_classes)
        self.softmax_cross_entropy = layer.SoftMaxCrossEntropy()

    def forward(self, inputs):  # define the forward function
        y = self.linear1(inputs)
        y = self.relu(y)
        y = self.linear2(y)
        return y

    def train_one_batch(self, x, y):
        out = self.forward(x)
        loss = self.softmax_cross_entropy(out, y)
        self.optimizer(loss)
        return out, loss

    def set_optimizer(self, optimizer):  # attach an optimizer
        self.optimizer = optimizer
```

#### Training

```python
# create a model instance
model = MLP()
# initialize optimizer and attach it to the model
sgd = opt.SGD(lr=0.005, momentum=0.9, weight_decay=1e-5)
model.set_optimizer(sgd)
# input and target placeholders for the model
tx = tensor.Tensor((batch_size, 1, IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE), dev, tensor.float32)
ty = tensor.Tensor((batch_size, num_classes), dev, tensor.int32)
# compile the model before training
model.compile([tx], is_train=True, use_graph=True, sequential=False)

# train the model iteratively
for b in range(num_train_batch):
    # generate the next mini-batch
    x, y = ...

    # Copy the data into input tensors
    tx.copy_from_numpy(x)
    ty.copy_from_numpy(y)

    # Training with one batch
    out, loss = model(tx, ty)
```

#### Save a model checkpoint

```python
# define the path to save the checkpoint
checkpointpath="checkpoint.zip"

# save a checkpoint
model.save_states(fpath=checkpointpath)
```

#### Load a model checkpoint

```python
# define the path to load the checkpoint
checkpointpath="checkpoint.zip"

# load a checkpoint
import os
if os.path.exists(checkpointpath):
    model.load_states(fpath=checkpointpath)
```
