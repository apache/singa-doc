The Device abstract represents a hardware device with memory and computing
units. All [Tensor operations](./tensor) are scheduled by the resident device
for execution. Tensor memory is also managed by the device's memory manager.
Therefore, optimization of memory and execution are implemented in the Device
class.

## Specific devices

Currently, SINGA has three Device implmentations,

1.  CudaGPU for an Nvidia GPU card which runs Cuda code
2.  CppCPU for a CPU which runs Cpp code
3.  OpenclGPU for a GPU card which runs OpenCL code

## Example Usage

The following code provides examples of creating devices:

```python
from singa import device
cuda = device.create_cuda_gpu_on(0)  # use GPU card of ID 0
host = device.get_default_device()  # get the default host device (a CppCPU)
ary1 = device.create_cuda_gpus(2)  # create 2 devices, starting from ID 0
ary2 = device.create_cuda_gpus([0,2])  # create 2 devices on ID 0 and 2
```
