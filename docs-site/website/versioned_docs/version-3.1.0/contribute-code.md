## Coding Style

The SINGA codebase follows the Google Style for both
[CPP](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml) and
[Python](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) code.

A simple way to enforce the Google coding styles is to use the linting and
formating tools in the Visual Studio Code editor:

- [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
- [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [cpplint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mine.cpplint)
- [Clang-Format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xaver.clang-format)

Once the extensions are installed, edit the `settings.json` file.

```json
{
  "[cpp]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "xaver.clang-format"
  },
  "cpplint.cpplintPath": "path/to/cpplint",

  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "python.formatting.provider": "yapf",
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.lintOnSave": true,
  "clang-format.language.cpp.style": "google",
  "python.formatting.yapfArgs": ["--style", "{based_on_style: google}"]
}
```

Depending on your platform, the user settings file is located here:

1. Windows %APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json
2. macOS "\$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json"
3. Linux "\$HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json"

Configurations are specified in corresponding config files. And these tools
would look up for configuration files in the root of the project automatically,
e.g. `.pylintrc`.

#### Tool Installation

It is ideal when all the contributors uses the same version of code formatting
tool (clang-format 9.0.0 and yapf 0.29.0), so that all code formatting in
different PRs would be identical to get rid of github pull request conflicts.

First, install LLVM 9.0 which provides clang-format version 9.0.0. The download
page of LLVM is:

- [LLVM](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html#9.0.0)

  - On Ubuntu

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install clang-format-9
    ```

  - On Windows. Download the pre-built package and install

Second, install cpplint, pylint and yapf

- Ubuntu or OSX:

  ```
  $ sudo pip install cpplint
  $ which cpplint
  /path/to/cpplint

  $ pip install yapf==0.29.0
  $ pip install pylint
  ```

- Windows: Install Anaconda for package management.

  ```
  $ pip install cpplint
  $ where cpplint
  C:/path/to/cpplint.exe

  $ pip install yapf==0.29.0
  $ pip install pylint
  ```

#### Usage

- After the configuration, linting should be automatically applied when editing
  source code file. Errors and warnings are listed in Visual Studio Code
  `PROBLEMS` panel.
- Code Formatting could be done by bringing up Command Palette(`Shift+Ctrl+P` in
  Windows or `Shift+Command+P` in OSX) and type `Format Document`.

#### Submission

You need to fix the format errors before submitting the pull requests.

## Developing Environment

Visual Studio Code is recommended as the editor. Extensions like Python, C/C++,
Code Spell Checker, autoDocstring, vim, Remote Development could be installed. A
reference configuration (i.e., `settings.json`) of these extensions is
[here](https://gist.github.com/nudles/3d23cfb6ffb30ca7636c45fe60278c55).

If you update the CPP code, you need to recompile SINGA
[from source](./build.md). It is recommended to use the native building tools in
the `*-devel` Docker images or `conda build`.

If you only update the Python code, you can install SINGAS once, and then copy
the updated Python files to replace those in the Python installation folder,

```shell
cp python/singa/xx.py  <path to conda>/lib/python3.7/site-packages/singa/
```

## Workflow

Please refer to the [git workflow page](./git-workflow.md).
