The process of building SINGA from source on Microsoft Windows has four parts:
install dependencies, build SINGA source, (optionally) install the python module
and (optionally) run the unit tests.

## Install Dependencies

You may create a folder for building the dependencies.

The dependencies are:

- Compiler and IDE
  - Visual Studio. The community edition is free and can be used to build SINGA.
    https://www.visualstudio.com/
- CMake
  - Can be downloaded from http://cmake.org/
  - Make sure the path to cmake executable is in the system path, or use full
    path when calling cmake.
- SWIG

  - Can be downloaded from http://swig.org/
  - Make sure the path to swig executable is in the system path, or use full
    path when calling swig. Use a recent version such as 3.0.12.

- Protocol Buffers
  - Download a suitable version such as 2.6.1:
    https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/tag/v2.6.1 .
  - Download both protobuf-2.6.1.zip and protoc-2.6.1-win32.zip .
  - Extract both of them in dependencies folder. Add the path to protoc
    executable to the system path, or use full path when calling it.
  - Open the Visual Studio solution which can be found in vsproject folder.
  - Change the build settings to Release and x64.
  - build libprotobuf project.
- Openblas

  - Download a suitable source version such as 0.2.20 from
    http://www.openblas.net
  - Extract the source in the dependencies folder.
  - If you don't have Perl installed, download a perl environment such as
    Strawberry Perl (http://strawberryperl.com/)
  - Build the Visual Studio solution by running this command in the source
    folder:

  ```bash
  cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
  ```

  - Open the Visual Studio solution and change the build settings to Release and
    x64.
  - Build libopenblas project

- Google glog
  - Download a suitable version such as 0.3.5 from
    https://github.com/google/glog/releases
  - Extract the source in the dependencies folder.
  - Open the Visual Studio solution.
  - Change the build settings to Release and x64.
  - Build libglog project

## Build SINGA source

- Download SINGA source code
- Compile the protobuf files:

  - Go to src/proto folder

  ```shell
  mkdir python_out
  protoc.exe *.proto --python_out python_out
  ```

- Generate swig interfaces for C++ and Python: Go to src/api

  ```shell
  swig -python -c++ singa.i
  ```

- generate Visual Studio solution for SINGA: Go to SINGA source code root folder

  ```shell
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ```

- Call cmake and add the paths in your system similar to the following example:

  ```shell
  cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" ^
    -DGLOG_INCLUDE_DIR="D:/WinSinga/dependencies/glog-0.3.5/src/windows" ^
    -DGLOG_LIBRARIES="D:/WinSinga/dependencies/glog-0.3.5/x64/Release" ^
    -DCBLAS_INCLUDE_DIR="D:/WinSinga/dependencies/openblas-0.2.20/lapack-netlib/CBLAS/include" ^
    -DCBLAS_LIBRARIES="D:/WinSinga/dependencies/openblas-0.2.20/lib/RELEASE" ^
    -DProtobuf_INCLUDE_DIR="D:/WinSinga/dependencies/protobuf-2.6.1/src" ^
    -DProtobuf_LIBRARIES="D:/WinSinga/dependencies/protobuf-2.6.1/vsprojects/x64/Release" ^
    -DProtobuf_PROTOC_EXECUTABLE="D:/WinSinga/dependencies/protoc-2.6.1-win32/protoc.exe" ^
    ..
  ```

- Open the generated solution in Visual Studio

- Add the singa_wrap.cxx file from src/api to the singa_objects project
- In the singa_objects project, open Additional Include Directories.
- Add Python include path
- Add numpy include path
- Add protobuf include path
- In the preprocessor definitions of the singa_objects project, add USE_GLOG
- Build singa_objects project

- In singa project:

  - add singa_wrap.obj to Object Libraries
  - change target name to \_singa_wrap
  - change target extension to .pyd
  - change configuration type to Dynamic Library (.dll)
  - go to Additional Library Directories and add the path to python, openblas,
    protobuf and glog libraries
  - go to Additional Dependencies and add libopenblas.lib, libglog.lib and
    libprotobuf.lib

- build singa project

## Install Python module

- Change `_singa_wrap.so` to `_singa_wrap.pyd` in build/python/setup.py
- Copy the files in `src/proto/python_out` to `build/python/singa/proto`

- Optionally create and activate a virtual environment:

  ```shell
  mkdir SingaEnv
  virtualenv SingaEnv
  SingaEnv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- go to build/python folder and run:

  ```shell
  python setup.py install
  ```

- Make \_singa_wrap.pyd, libglog.dll and libopenblas.dll available by adding
  them to the path or by copying them to singa package folder in the python
  site-packages

- Verify that SINGA is installed by running:

  ```shell
  python -c "from singa import tensor"
  ```

    libprotobuf.lib. Fix the names of the two libraries: gtest.lib and
    singa_objects.lib.
