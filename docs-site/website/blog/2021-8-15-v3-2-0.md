- Add support for half-precision floating-point format (fp16) in deep learning models and computational kernels.

- Update new ONNX APIs and fix ONNX examples accordingly, namely, DenseNet121, ShuffleNetv1, ShuffleNetv2, SqueezeNet, VGG19.

- Add a new method to resize images by given width and height.

- Use Docusaurus versioning to simplify the process of generating the project homepage.
