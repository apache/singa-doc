The SINGA team is excited to announce the launch of the Healthcare Model Zoo, a repository of different deep-learning models designed to advance the landscape of healthcare applications. This embodies SINGA's commitment to harnessing artificial intelligence to foster improvements in personalized healthcare.

The Model Zoo currently publishes curated models for diabetic retinopathy classification, malaria detection, and thyroid eye disease detection. Each model addresses significant health concerns and is crafted to assist healthcare professionals in improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.
