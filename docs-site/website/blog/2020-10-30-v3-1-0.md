Apache SINGA V3.1.0 is released on October 30, 2020. There are six major features added in this release.

- Update the Tensor core to support tensor transformations (reshape, transpose) for tensors up to 6 dimensions and implement traverse-unary-transform in the Cuda backend, similar to the CPP backend.

- Add new tensor operators into the autograd module.

- Reconstruct sonnx to support creating operators from both layer and autograd, re-write SingaRep for a more powerful intermediate representation of SINGA, and add a SONNXModel for a uniform API and features.

- Replace Travis CI with Github workflow and add quality and coverage management.

- Add compiling and packaging scripts to create wheel packages for distribution.

- Fix bugs including the IMDB LSTM model example training script, Tensor operation Mult on Broadcasting use cases, Gaussian function on Tensor with odd size, and update a testing helper function gradients() in autograd to lookup param gradient by param python object id for testing purposes
