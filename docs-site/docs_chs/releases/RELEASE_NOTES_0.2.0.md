SINGA is a general distributed deep learning platform for training big deep
learning models over large datasets. It is designed with an intuitive
programming model based on the layer abstraction. SINGA supports a wide variety
of popular deep learning models.

This release includes the following **major features**:

- [Training on GPU](../docs/gpu.html) enables training of complex models on a
  single node with multiple GPU cards.
- [Hybrid neural net partitioning](../docs/hybrid.html) supports data and model
  parallelism at the same time.
- [Python wrapper](../docs/python.html) makes it easy to configure the job,
  including neural net and SGD algorithm.
- [RNN model and BPTT algorithm](../docs/general-rnn.html) are implemented to
  support applications based on RNN models, e.g., GRU.
- [Cloud software integration](../docs/distributed-training.md) includes Mesos,
  Docker and HDFS.
